This repository contain a notebook with an exercise that solve a Kaggle competion. \
The Kaggle competition aimed to predict the CO2 emission by using some atmospherical features. In order to solve this I used a random forest and previously a Principal Component Analysis + Simple Imputation + Standardization to reduce the huge dimensionality of the data.\
The final result is good, totalizing a 6.9% error in the test set.\
